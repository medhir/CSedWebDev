					<p>Our first design project is going to be designing a blog. 

					You’re probably familiar with the idea of a blog already, but there are a few things that we need to cover before we actually get into deciding what will go into making your blog specifically. 

					Before we can get into the nitty gritty part of what your blog will look like, let's get you up to speed on some basic HTML and CSS knowledge. 

					You will first learn to get comfortable with the syntax of HTML and CSS. Codeacademy provides great resources for exactly this purpose.

					Once you’ve finished that, you can move on to the intermediate step. If you’ve worked with HTML before, or the tutorial seemed a little too familiar for you, feel free to skip ahead. </p>

						</div>
					</div>

					<p>As you work through the Code Academy course, there are a few concepts that you should pay particularly close attention to. These are concepts that we are going to use in our big design project at this tutorial, so you'll definitely want to understand them. 
						-Understanding tags and how they affect the way that a webpage looks
						-Understanding the way that a layout is affected by changes in code
						-Adding features to the look of a webpage that help the user move around the page, or interact with it

					These tools are especially prominent in the parts of the Code Academy material named "HTML Basics (I-III)," "Build Your Own Webpage," and "Design a Button for your Website.<p>

					<h4 class="heading">Second steps...</h4>
					<p>Once you've gone through Code Academy's web track, use Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML + CSS tutorials. Although much of this material will overlap with the first resource, it will help reinforce your understanding of specific concepts. This resource also has the benefit of producing a beautiful web page from start to finish.</p>
					<p><a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Shay Howe: Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS</a></p>

					<p>This is a very practical tutorial in that it will show you how to build a webpage from start to finish. After you finish with this recourse, you'll move on to a design project, which will be building your very own blog from the ground up using HTML and CSS. 

					In that way, this tutorial actually parallels your independent design project in a lot of ways; a key difference is that whereas this resource very closely guides you through what to do, your blog design will be more up to you.<p>

					<h4 class="heading">Design Project: Make your blog!</h4>

					<p>Now, you’ve established a foundation. You’re officially ready to spread your wings and begin building your blog at this point. 

					Before we start coding anything, though, we should take the time to ask ourselves a few questions about what a blog actually looks like. 

					You can personalize your blog to suit your preferences, of course, but there are certain fundamental features that we’d like to include too...<p>
