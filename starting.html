					<h4 class="heading">The Mindset</h4>
					<p>Learning web development in the present can be tricky. That’s frustrating, because it really isn’t all that difficult. It can be confusing at times, sure, but the content really isn’t the problem; rather, we proffer that the more fundamental issue is the teaching tools currently available.</p>
					<p>People wishing to learn web development are faced with conflicting opinions about where to start, and the slurry of some-better-than-others teaching tools that are readily available online can, at times, be overwhelming.</p>
					<p>Our goal is to take the complication out of learning web development. We aim to demystify the process as a whole as we direct users through a linear path of curated resources and projects. Our resources come from various sites across the Internet-- the trick is that we chose the best ones. This saves you, the user, from having to sift through the confusing, at times, inaccurate teaching tools that are out there in order to learn quickly and effectively.</p>

					<h4 class="heading">The Setup</h4>
					<p>First things first, you will need a <strong>text editor</strong> in order to write your programs. A text editor is the simplest environment where you can produce code.</p> 

					<p>We recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. This is a powerful and commonly used text editor that provides a straightforward way to get started. </p>

					</div>
					<h5 class="caption">Sublime Text is our editor of choice.</h5>

					<p>You may have heard of <strong>IDEs</strong> (Integrated Development Environemnts), which are another resource commonly used by software engineers to produce computer programs. We suggest that you start out with a text editor. There are many reasons for this.</p>

					<ul class="list">
						<li>A text editor is <strong>lightweight</strong>, and requires much less memory than most IDEs.</li>
						<li>Using a text editor will <strong>force you to write out</strong> most of your code, instead of having it be completed automatically.</li>
						<li>A text editor provides a <strong>low-distraction</strong> environment.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4 class="heading">How Our Projects Work</h4>
					<p>Once you’ve gotten past the initial resources described above, we’ll have you go through a project to test your wings a bit by having you implement a practical piece of code using the knowledge you’ve gained.</p>

					<h5 class="caption">Our step-by-step approach to learning new concepts</h5>

					<p>This section will basically give you a list of questions that you should be able to answer after having gone through the resources. They’re usually multiple choice, and it’s no big deal if you get them wrong. The main point of the questions is to point you in the right direction for where to go with your code; between questions, you should be bouncing back to Sublime Text or whatever tool you’re using to write your code and actually begin implementing your project there.</p>

					<p>Also, don’t worry if a question is stumping you! After two wrong answers, we’ll give you the option to actually check out the solution code, so you should never feel like you don’t know how to move forward. With that said, we’d suggest that you start off with our Design project. </p>

					<p><strong>Happy coding!</strong></p>
