						<h4 class="heading">Introduction</h4>
						<p>
							<strong>Web development</strong> is a broad subset of general software development that is responsible for the creation of websites. 
							It is <strong>broad</strong> because designing/programming a website involves many moving parts, and there are multiple ways to complete specific tasks.
						</p>
						<p class="break">We believe, as a beginner, it is difficult to learn how to create software for the web because of the vast number of resources that exist. This website is dedicated to providing guidance and a curated set of resources with which you will be able to get your feet wet and start making websites, with or without prior programming experience. Browse through this page to see the different projects available.</p>

						<h4 class="heading">Projects</h4>
						<p>The projects are meant to walk you through various development resources, while also gaining practical experience by working on a real project. The projects have been made to work on the same website in sequential order. For the total beginner, it will be best to start with the "Design" section. If you feel comfortable with any of the concepts described, feel free to skip ahead. If you notice you feel uncomfortable with specific concepts, feel free to jump back to previous tracks to brush up your knowledge. </p>
