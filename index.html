						<h3>So you're on this page... now what?</h3>
						<p>
							<em>Web development</em> is a broad subset of general software development that is responsible for the creation of websites. 
							It is <em>broad</em> because designing/programming a website involves many moving parts, and there are multiple ways to complete specific tasks. We believe, as a beginner, it is difficult to learn how to create software for the web because of the vast number of resources that exist. This website is dedicated to providing guidance and a curated set of resources with which you will be able to get your feet wet and start making websites, with or without prior programming experience. Browse through this page to see the different tracks available.
