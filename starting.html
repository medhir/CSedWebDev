					<h4 class="heading">The Mindset</h4>
					<p>Learning web development in the present can be tricky. That’s frustrating, because it really isn’t all that difficult. It can be confusing at times, sure, but the content really isn’t the problem; rather, we proffer that the more fundamental issue is the teaching tools currently available.</p>
					<p>People wishing to learn web development are faced with conflicting opinions about where to start, and the slurry of some-better-than-others teaching tools that are readily available online can, at times, be overwhelming.</p>
					<p>Our goal is to take the complication out of learning web development. We aim to demystify the process as a whole as we direct users through a linear path of curated resources and projects. Our resources come from various sites across the Internet-- the trick is that we chose the best ones. This saves you, the user, from having to sift through the confusing, at times, inaccurate teaching tools that are out there in order to learn quickly and effectively.</p>

					<h4 class="heading">The Setup</h4>
					<p>First things first, you will need a <strong>text editor</strong> in order to write your programs. A text editor is the simplest environment where you can produce code.</p> 

					<p>We recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. This is a powerful and commonly used text editor that provides a straightforward way to get started. </p>

					</div>
					<h5 class="caption">Sublime Text is our editor of choice.</h5>

					<p>You may have heard of <strong>IDEs</strong> (Integrated Development Environemnts), which are another resource commonly used by software engineers to produce computer programs. We suggest that you start out with a text editor. There are many reasons for this.</p>

					<ul class="list">
						<li>A text editor is <strong>lightweight</strong>, and requires much less memory than most IDEs.</li>
						<li>Using a text editor will <strong>force you to write out</strong> most of your code, instead of having it be completed automatically.</li>
						<li>A text editor provides a <strong>low-distraction</strong> environment.</li>
					</ul>
